<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Epoxy Flooring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dissipative Type</li><li>Conductive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static epoxy flooring market includes two main types: dissipative and conductive. Dissipative flooring allows static charges to dissipate gradually, providing protection in environments where electronic components are handled. It has a higher electrical resistance, making it suitable for areas with less stringent static control requirements. Conductive flooring, on the other hand, provides a lower resistance path for static discharge, quickly redirecting charges to ground. This type is ideal for environments with sensitive electronic equipment and stringent electrostatic discharge protection needs.</p></p>
