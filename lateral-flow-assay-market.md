<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Flow Assay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Assays</li><li>Competitive Assays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lateral flow assay market primarily features two types: sandwich assays and competitive assays. Sandwich assays detect the target analyte by using two antibodies, forming a complex that produces a visible signal, making them highly specific and sensitive for biomarkers. In contrast, competitive assays work by measuring the amount of target analyte in a sample by competing it against a labeled version; lower signal intensity indicates higher analyte levels. Both types are widely used in diagnostics, food safety, and environmental testing.</p></p>
